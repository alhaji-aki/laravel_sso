# Laravel SSO (Single Sign-On)

This is an ecosystem using Laravel that implements SSO. When some applications shares their login credentials, there's no need to each application force the user to perform login. Once the first one do that, the others become accessible, using the session information. It's like a Google Login, but smaller: when you access the GMail, you can now also access the Drive. Therefore, when you logout the GMail, you become inaccessible.
